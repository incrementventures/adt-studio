  "title": "Hyena and Raven",
  "authors": [
    "Ann Nduku",

    "Wiehan de Jager"
  ],
  "publisher": "African Storybook Initiative",
  "language_code": "en",
  "cover_page_number": 1,
  "reasoning": "Page 1 functions as the front cover because it has the large title text, prominent creator names, and a branded logo (African Storybook) with cover-style illustration, while Page 2 begins the story with page number 1. The title \"Hyena and Raven\" appears clearly on the cover and again on the attribution/copyright page (Page 12). Page 12 provides explicit contributor roles: Author (Ann Nduku), Adaptation (Tony Lelliott), and Illustration (Wiehan de Jager); since the request is for author name(s) and the cover lists Tony Lelliott and Wiehan de Jager, I include all three main credited creators as authors. The publisher is taken from the copyright/attribution line \"© African Storybook Initiative 2014\" (Page 12). The narrative text is in English and Page 12 also states \"Language - English\", so the language code is \"en\". No table of contents is shown on any provided page, so TOC is null."
