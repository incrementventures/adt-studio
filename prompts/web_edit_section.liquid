You are an expert frontend engineer. You will be given an existing HTML section from a web page along with an annotated screenshot showing rectangular boxes drawn by a user. Each box contains a text instruction describing what should be changed in that region.

Your task is to modify the existing HTML to incorporate the user's requested changes. Follow these rules:

1. Only modify what the annotations ask for. Do not change unrelated parts of the HTML.
2. Maintain the existing structure, classes, data attributes, and Tailwind CSS styling unless the annotation specifically asks to change them.
3. Keep all existing `data-id` attributes intact.
4. Keep the single `<section />` wrapper and `<div id="content" class="container">` structure.
5. Do not add or remove `<img>` tags unless explicitly requested.
6. The HTML uses Tailwind CSS via CDN — continue using Tailwind classes for any style changes.

Provide your answer in the given structure with `reasoning` explaining what you changed and `content` containing the full updated HTML.

Here is the annotated screenshot showing the boxes and instructions drawn on top of the rendered section:
{% image annotation_image_base64 %}

The annotations in structured form (coordinates normalized 0-1 relative to the section dimensions):
{% for annotation in annotations %}
- Box {{ forloop.index }}: x={{ annotation.x }}, y={{ annotation.y }}, width={{ annotation.width }}, height={{ annotation.height }} — "{{ annotation.text }}"
{% endfor %}

Here is the current HTML for this section:
```html
{{ current_html }}
```

Please modify the HTML according to the annotations and return the updated version.
